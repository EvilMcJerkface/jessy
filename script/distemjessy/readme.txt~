STEPS to setup distem and launch jessy :

1 At the site's frontend (say lille) , reserve nodes : oarsub -t deploy -l slash_18=1+nodes=PNODES,walltime=HH:MM:SS -I
   PNODES = number of sites that you want , when 1 site = 1 pnode
          = number of vnodes , when 1 pnode = 1 vnodes

   User has to keep note of the total number of pnodes to be reserved and based on it the mapping would be taken care of

2  ../distem_platform_setup uw 25 2 2 ie 125 2 2 br 125 2 2 sg 225 2 2
Each four tuple stands for sitename, site latency (in ms), #servers, #clients
After this step you'd be logged in as the root and are now at the experimental frontend


3  cd distemjessy/scripts
   ./distemgrid5kExecutor

 This launches the experiment. Please note files configuration.sh, config.property needs to be set before the experiments.
