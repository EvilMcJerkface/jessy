To load data, and write them in a file using the scripts:
1. Set config.properties and ycsb parameters.
2. Change the input argument in jessy.sh from "loadfromdisk" to "savetodisk"
3. in experience.sh, change the sleep time in stopExp function, and increase it. 
This is required to let servers write the loaded data into disk.
If this value is not big enough (more than seconds), servers will terminate before dumping in-memory objects.
4. Uncomment the loading phase in experience.sh     
5. Uncomment line CLAUNCHER_SUCCEED=1. Otherwise, script thinks there is a problem with the execution, and retries again.
6. You can also comment the benchmarking phase if you only need to save data and quit.
