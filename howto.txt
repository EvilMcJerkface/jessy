In the following, we explain how to run the experiments in grid5000 testbed. 

General:
ConstantPool.java: Set read/update transactions parameters 

SDUR_VV_GC:
configuration.sh: Set cons to "sdur_vv_gc"
config.property: Set partitioner_type to sequential
config.property: Set replication_factor to 1
config.property: Set group_size to x where x is the number of replicas inside each group. 
Each group will then replicate the very same set of objects. 

NMSI_PDV_2PC:
configuration.sh: Set cons to "nmsi_pdv_2pc"
config.property: Set partitioner_type to replicatedsequential
config.property: Set replication_factor to x where x is the number of replicas replicating the same objects.
config.property: Set group_size to 1. 
There will be one replica per group.  


GMU_GMV_2PC:
configuration.sh: Set cons to "gmu_gmv_2pc"
config.property: Set partitioner_type to replicatedsequential
config.property: Set replication_factor to x where x is the number of replicas replicating the same objects.
config.property: Set group_size to 1. 
There will be one replica per group.


Walter_VV_2PC:
configuration.sh: Set cons to "walter_vv_2pc"
config.property: Set partitioner_type to replicatedsequential
config.property: Set replication_factor to x where x is the number of replicas replicating the same objects.
config.property: Set group_size to 1. 
There will be one replica per group.
