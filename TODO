- TODO List for Jessy -

last update: P. Sutra, 23/07/2012


- [add] PartitionnedDependenceVector : cause we do not scale 
       (e.g., 3 servers 3*4 clients, 10^6 objects,
        after 2 minutes, vectors are of size 3*10^3 )
         
- [add] add more consistency tests for NMSI.

- [fix] vectors should not be generic  (that is, there are all ValueVector<String> ) 
        OR partitioner should be generic.

- [Fix] ExecutionHistory should only contains (i) a vector that defines the entities read by the transaction,
  and (ii) the set of updates entities.  Currently it is too heavy weighted.
