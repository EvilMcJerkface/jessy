(always in order of importance)

- [add] PartitionnedDependenceVector : cause we do not scale 
        (e.g., 3 servers 3*4 clients, 10^6 objects,
        after 2 minutes, vectors are of size 3*10^3 )
        The size of a partition is a parameter.

- [fix] ExecutionHistory should only contains (i) a vector that defines the entities read by the transaction,
  and (ii) the set of updates entities.  Currently it is too heavy weighted.

- [fix] vectors should not be generic  (that is, there are all ValueVector<String> ) 
        OR partitioner should be generic.
        
- [add] add more consistency tests for NMSI.
