- add more consistency tests for NMSI.
- vectors should not be generic , that is there are all ValueVector<String>
  or partitioner should be generic.
- an execution history should only contains (i) a vector that defines the entities read by the transaction,
  and (ii) the set of updates entities.  Currently it is too heavy weighted.
